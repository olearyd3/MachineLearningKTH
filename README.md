# Lab 1: Decision Trees

This lab revolved around decision trees, entropy and information gain. 

# Lab 2: Support Vector Machines

This lab involved studying the difference between using linear kernels, polynomial kernels and RBF kernels for SVMs. Slack and complexity were also explored.

# Lab 3: Bayesian Boosting

This lab involved using boosting and comparing the effect of boosted vs non-boosted classification.
